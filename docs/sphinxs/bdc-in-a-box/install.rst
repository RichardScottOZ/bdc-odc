Installing
===============

``bdc-in-a-box`` is a tool created for the Linux environment, which consuming ``stac2odc`` functionalities, allows different data cubes to be made considering different temporal and spatial extensions. To use ``bdc-in-a-box`` it is only necessary to have the essential ODC environment configured (ODC-Core and PostgreSQL), besides having ``stac2odc`` installed.

The ``ODC-Core`` image available in the BDC-ODC already presents in its files the bdc-in-a-box, which makes its use recommended. If you need the ODC-Core image, consult the `Getting Started page <../getting-started.html#getting-started>`_ and follow the steps. On the other hand, if you want to consume the scripts directly, access the `BDC-ODC repository <https://github.com/brazil-data-cube/bdc-odc>`_ and get the files (Recommended for advanced users)
