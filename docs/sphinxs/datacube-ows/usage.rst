Usage
=======

Once the OWS is configured, it can be consumed in several ways. To exemplify the use of OWS services, some examples have been created. These are available in the `BDC-ODC repository <https://github.com/brazil-data-cube/bdc-odc>`_. The available examples are listed below

- `Consuming the ODC-WCS with Python <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/brazil-data-cube/bdc-odc/blob/master/examples/wcs/CB4_64_16D_STK_1.ipynb>`_
- `Web Data Cube with ODC-WMTS and JavaScript <https://github.com/brazil-data-cube/bdc-odc/tree/master/examples/wmts-viewer>`_
