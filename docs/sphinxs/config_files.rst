Configuration files
====================

As presented throughout the tutorials present in this documentation, configuring ODC tools requires creating several configuration files. To centralize and make it simple to reproduce the ODC environment created within the BDC infrastructure, configuration files for all services are available in the `BDC-ODC repository <https://github.com/brazil-data-cube/bdc-odc>`_.

In the repository are available configurations of the following services and processes

**Services**

- `datacube-explorer <https://github.com/brazil-data-cube/bdc-odc/tree/master/config/datacube-explorer>`_
- `datacube-ows <https://github.com/brazil-data-cube/bdc-odc/tree/master/config/datacube-ows>`_

**Processes**

- `Ingestion of BDC's datacubes <https://github.com/brazil-data-cube/bdc-odc/tree/master/config/datacube-core/ingest>`_
