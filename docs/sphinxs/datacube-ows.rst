Disseminating data with ODC-OGC Services
==========================================

The ``datacube-ows`` was created to allow the access and search of the data products cataloged in the ODC without the need to use the specific tools created for this, which allows data interoperability. This section presents its form of configuration and use.

All configuration files presented in this step by step are available in the `BDC-ODC repository <https://github.com/brazil-data-cube/bdc-odc/tree/master/config/datacube-explorer>`_.
